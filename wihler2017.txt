Although prior research indicated that extraversion and conscientiousness are 
uniformly beneﬁcial to sales per-
formance, recent evidence suggests that scholars should consider nonlinearity, 
narrow personality, social skill,
and the research context in the personality-performance relation. Further, 
scholars have found conscientiousness
to have inverted U-shaped relationships with performance. Taking these into 
account, the present study exam-
ines the nonlinear relation that the combined conscientiousness facets of 
discipline and achievement motivation
(i.e., disciplined achievement motivation) have with objective sales 
performance in a predictive study with a nine
month time interval. We argue that stable social potency, composed of the 
activity facet of extraversion, social
skill, and emotional stability, will moderate this nonlinear relation in the 
context of insurance ﬁeld sales, such
that the greatest sales performance will be from those high on both constructs. 
Our ﬁndings support our hypoth-
eses, demonstrating that a relevant social-related trait (i.e., stable social 
potency) can offset the potential down-
sides  of  high  disciplined  achievement  motivation  (e.g.,  perfectionism,  
and  workaholism),  helping  such
individuals to achieve high objective sales. Implications for theory and future 
research directions are discussed.

1. Introduction

Sales jobs deserve special attention because of their importance to
the success of organizations (Vinchur, Schippmann, Switzer, & Roth,
1998). Field sales positions are especially demanding, as the customer
needs to be identiﬁed and sought out (Blickle et al., 2012), and rejection
is an especially common occurrence when selling service products (e.g.,
insurance; McManus & Kelly, 1999). Consequently, high levels of per-
suasive effort, perseverance, and composure under pressure are vital
to success in sales positions (Vinchur et al., 1998).

Although conscientiousness has been related to sales performance
(Vinchur et al., 1998) and career success (Judge & Kammeyer-Mueller,
2012), at high levels, it can be manifested in behaviors unhelpful to
work performance (e.g., workaholism and rigidity, Hmel & Pincus,
2002; Samuel, Riddell, Lynam, Miller, & Widiger, 2012). Given the com-
mon refrain within personality research to hire and promote individuals
high on conscientiousness and the importance of sales positions to orga-
nizations, the sales-related pitfalls of high conscientiousness deserve
particular attention. The present study seeks to offset these downsides
by interactively combining conscientiousness-related traits with sales-
relevant socially-related traits, arguing that those high on both will
demonstrate the greatest performance.

Further, personality scholars have argued that performance predic-
tion can be enhanced by examining narrow personality (see Robie &
Ryan,  1999),  aligning  personality  with  a  study's  context  (Tett  &
Burnett, 2003), and considering nonlinear relations with performance
(e.g., Penney, David,& Witt, 2011). The present study employs each of
these approaches, examining the nonlinear interaction of disciplined
achievement motivation (i.e., combined conscientiousness facets of dis-
cipline  and achievement motivation) with stable social potency (i.e., the
combination of the activity facet of extraversion, social skill, and emo-
tional stability) in prediction of nine-month-later sales performance in
the insurance sales context.

2. Conscientiousness and extraversion - narrower personality in the
sales context

Within sales jobs, conscientiousness and extraversion have been
meta-analytically demonstrated to be the strongest predictors of perfor-
mance (Hurtz & Donovan, 2000; Vinchur et al., 1998). However, re-
searchers  have  begun  to  claim  that  the  personality-performance
relation may be nonlinear (e.g., Penney et al., 2011), and both conscien-
tiousness (e.g., Le et al., 2011) and extraversion (e.g., Grant, 2013) have
demonstrated curvilinear, inverted U-shaped relationships with perfor-
mance. In addition, these associations could be context dependent (Tett
& Burnett, 2003) and narrow personality within the overall factor could
have different relations with performance (Robie & Ryan, 1999).

Although the trend in empirical personality research is to examine
facets in exclusion, theory has emphasized matching the bandwidth
and  relevance  of  predictor(s)  with  the  criterion  (e.g.,  Paunonen,
Rothstein, & Jackson, 1999; Penney et al., 2011). Further, research
(e.g., DeYoung, Quilty, & Peterson, 2007) has demonstrated that the
Big Five has three bandwidth levels (i.e., factor, aspect, and facet). Con-
sequently, although our outcome (i.e., sales performance) is not as
broad   as overall performance, neither is it as narrow as a very speciﬁc
type of sales performance (e.g., with a particular product, sales context,
or customer). Therefore, we endeavored to utilize predictors at a similar
(i.e., aspect) bandwidth.

Regarding conscientiousness, based on prior research (i.e., Hurtz &
Donovan, 2000; Vinchur et al., 1998), we chose two facets (i.e., self-dis-
cipline and achievement motivation) that are contained in the same,
overarching aspect (i.e., industriousness; DeYoung et al., 2007) and
that we believe are those most relevant to the ﬁeld sales context, nam-
ing their combination disciplined achievement motivation (DAM). Self-
discipline describes the ability to start and complete tasks (Costa &
McCrae, 1992), and, using the O*NET database (Occupational Informa-
tion Network; Peterson et al., 2001), Sackett and Walmsley (2014)
found that dependability, conceptually similar to self-discipline, was
the highest ranked attribute in sales jobs. Similarly, achievement moti-
vation refers to a desire to compete with and attain greater competency
than others (Baranik, Stanley, Bynum, & Lance, 2010), and it has been
linked to many measures of career accomplishment (e.g., decades-
later occupational status; Judge & Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012), including
objective sales performance (Vinchur et al., 1998; Warr, Bartram, &
Martin, 2005).

However, extreme conscientiousness can have negative effects, such
as self-critical perfectionism (Dunkley, Blankstein, Zuroff, Lecce, & Hui,
2006)  and  greater  adverse  stress  reactions  to  negative  feedback
(Cianci, Klein, & Seijts, 2010). In ﬁeld sales positions, negative feedback
and rejection from customers is a common occurrence, particularly
when  selling  service  products  like  insurance  (McManus  &  Kelly,
1999). At high levels, achievement motivated individuals can be de-
scribed as self-focused workaholics, and discipline can become a sin-
gle-minded rigidity (Hmel & Pincus, 2002; Samuel et al., 2012). Also,
research has shown that both self-discipline and impulsivity, conceptu-
ally similar to low discipline, have nonlinear relations with outcomes,
with  moderate  levels  relating  to  higher  well-being  (Carter,  Guan,
Maples, Williamson, & Miller, 2016) and success (Day & Silverman,
1989) than low or high levels. Thus, it seems that, in isolation, DAM
will  have  an  inverted  U-shaped  relation  with  sales  performance,
which is counter to the presumption that high achievement-oriented
individuals will produce the highest sales performance (Vinchur et al.,
1998).

Consequently, the present study interacts DAM with stable social po-
tency (SSP, i.e., the combined traits of the activity facet of extraversion,
social skill, and emotional stability) in a nonlinear prediction of objec-
tive sales performance. Prior research in other contexts has shown
that those simultaneously high on both conscientiousness- and extra-
version-related traits have the highest work performance (e.g., Witt,
2002;      Witt & Ferris, 2003, Study 4). Moreover, personality scholars
have argued that the joint inﬂuence of multiple traits should be exam-
ined (Penney et al., 2011), and that the inﬂection point for a nonlinear
relation with performance could be different between traits (Pierce &
Aguinis, 2013). Thus, we contend that, when interacted with SSP, the
detrimental effects of high DAM can be offset, creating a positive and
strengthening  relation  with  performance  for  those  high  on  SSP  as
DAM increases.

Activity describes a desire to remain busy and work rapidly due to
feelings of urgency (Costa & McCrae, 1992). Since, in prediction of
sales performance, extraversion has shown an inverted U-shaped rela-
tion (Grant, 2013) and its credibility interval includes zero (Barrick,
Mount, & Judge, 2001), we desired to utilize a speciﬁc facet of extraver-
sion,  choosing  activity  because,  given  the  demanding  nature  of

insurance ﬁeld sales (Blickle et al., 2012; McManus & Kelly, 1999),
higher activity should be beneﬁcial to sales performance. Moreover,
the inability of a study (i.e., Denis, Morin, & Guindon, 2010) to ﬁnd a sig-
niﬁcant relationship between activity and task or global performance in
a sample including a range of jobs could indicate the importance of
context (e.g., ﬁeld sales). Also, in a large community sample, the la-
tent factor representing activity had the greatest number of negative
associations with psychopathology of any of the four extraversion
facets (Watson, Stasik, Ellickson-Larew, & Stanton, 2015), showing
activity  to  be  the  most  adaptive  extraversion  trait.  However,  at
high levels, activity could result in a zeal to rush and hurry through
tasks,  despite  low  quality  work.  Additionally,  Hambrick  and
McCord (2010) found activity to be negatively related to avoidance
coping, and, in a sales context, being unable to disengage from a
stressful customer situation (e.g., customer reluctance or rejection)
could be viewed as too aggressive and/or would be unproductive, re-
ducing performance.

Thus, we believe that achievement oriented salespersons who are
highly active also require heightened social skill and emotional sta-
bility to engage in more adaptive responses (e.g., acceptance or
avoidance coping) to stressful customer interactions, thereby, im-
proving sales performance. A variety of research has shown that per-
sonality needs social skill to affect behavior evaluated by others (see
Hogan & Blickle, 2013), including objective sales outcomes (Blickle,
Wendel, & Ferris, 2010). Furthermore, the combination of activity
and social skill is conceptually similar to the (social) potency con-
struct found to be related to objective sales success (Vinchur et al.,
1998; Warr et al., 2005).

Emotional stability is helpful to performance in social jobs, as
found across seven studies by Mount, Barrick, and Stewart (1998).
The emotionally stable engage in ways of coping (i.e., adaptive, pro-
active, and strategic) that are more socially conducive, and they are
less sensitive to others' emotions (Doherty, 1997), which should be
particularly helpful when managing challenging customer relations
that  threaten  sales.  Hurtz  and  Donovan's  (2000)  meta-analysis
showed  that  emotional  stability  had  nearly  as  strong  a  relation
with sales performance as did extraversion. Additionally, emotional
control  is  an  important  element  to  being  social  skilled  (Riggio,
1986),  and  the  greatest  customer  service  job  performance  has
come from those high on both emotional stability and extraversion
(Judge & Erez, 2007), indicating that, in social jobs, their combina-
tion is more helpful to performance than either trait in isolation.
Lastly, the highly conscientious tend to experience greater negative
affect (Fayard, Roberts, Robins, & Watson, 2012), and, thus, the pos-
itive relationship between conscientiousness and performance could
improve its strength when augmented by emotionally stability (see
Penney et al., 2011). This research evidence indicates that emotional
stability  could  be  helpful  to  extraversion  and  conscientiousness
traits in sales contexts.

In short, we argue that when stable social potency (SSP) is low, dis-
ciplined achievement motivation (DAM) will maintain an inverted U-
shaped relation with objective sales performance. Whereas, higher
levels of SSP will create an increasingly positive relationship of DAM
with performance, such that those high on both will have the highest
performance.

Hypothesis 1. SSP moderates the quadratic relation between DAM and
sales performance.

Hypothesis 1a. When SSP is low, there is a curvilinear relation between
DAM and sales performance, such that the relation is initially positive
but becomes weaker as DAM increases. When DAM further increases,
the relation becomes negative.

Hypothesis 1b. When SSP is high, there is a positively growing relation
between DAM and sales performance, such that the relation is initially
positive and becomes more positive as DAM increases.



3. Method

3.1. Participants and procedure

The study was conducted with the support of the Human Resources
(HR) department of a large German insurance company. HR sent email
messages to the insurance agents. The message included the study's in-
vitation, link to an online test, personal login code, and consent to use
nine-month-later sales performance. 389 agents were contacted, 165
followed       the link, and 114 ﬁnished the online test. One year later, HR
provided sales performance data (29% participation rate). Of the 114
participants, 15 were female. Participant mean age was 44.6 (SD =
9.3) years, having a job tenure of 12.5 years (SD = 8.2 years).

3.2. Measures

3.2.1. Disciplined achievement motivation (DAM)

To assess DAM, we built a composite from the conscientiousness
facets of self-discipline and achievement striving, measured using the
respective scales from the German version (Ostendorf & Angleitner,
2004)   of the Revised NEO-PI-R (Costa & McCrae, 1992). Each scale is
comprised of eight items. Sample items are “I'm pretty good about pacing
myself  so as to get things done on time” (self-discipline) and “I work hard
to accomplish my goals” (achievement striving). All Items are answered
on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 =
strongly agree. We averaged all items to get an overall DAM score. The
composite reliability (Wang & Stanley, 1970) for DAM was .87.

3.2.2. Stable social potency (SSP)

We measured SSP by using a composite score built of three con-
structs, namely, activity, social skill, and (low) negative affectivity.
First, we assessed activity using the eight items of the activity facet of ex-
traversion of the German version (Ostendorf & Angleitner, 2004) of the
Revised NEO-PI-R (Costa & McCrae, 1992). A sample item is “My life is
fast-paced.” Items are answered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from
1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. We assessed social skill
with  the  social  skill  facet  (Kholin  et  al., 2016;  Novack &  Kammer,
1987) of self-monitoring (Snyder, 1974). This scale consists of nine
true (=1) or false (=0) items. A sample items is “I can make impromptu
speeches even on topics about which I have almost no information” (true).
Finally, we assessed emotional stability by reversing the negative affec-
tivity scale (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988), since these two constructs
are often used interchangeably (see Fortunato, 2004). Negative affectiv-
ity is characterized by experiencing negative emotions (Watson & Clark,
1984). The instructions read “…to what extent do you feel this way gen-
erally.” A sample item includes “distressed.” Items are answered on a 5-
point Likert scale ranging from 1 = not at all to 5 = extremely. All 10
items were reverse-coded to assess emotional stability. We then aggre-
gated all items using their respective scales and computed the averaged
overall SSP score. The composite reliability (Wang & Stanley, 1970),
which takes into account different scale types, for SSP was .75.

3.2.3. Validation study

To assess the construct validity (Camara, 2003) of DAM and SSP
scales while avoiding range restriction (Pearlman, Schmidt, & Hunter,
1980), we conducted a study of 703 employees from a range of jobs,
using the German version of the PPI-R (Psychopathic Personality Inven-
tory-Revised; Alpers & Eisenbarth, 2008; Lilienfeld & Widows, 2005).
We     chose the PPI-R inventory for the validation study because we ex-
pected both discriminant and convergent validity with DAM and SSP
(Miller & Lynam, 2012).

Speciﬁcally, we expected discriminant validity (i.e., no substantial
correlations) of DAM and SSP with PPI-R subscales cold-heartedness
(CH,        α = .82) and Machiavellian egocentricity (ME, α = .75). The
data supported this expectation (r  (DAM, CH) = −.05, r  (DAM,
ME) = −.02, r (SSP, CH) = −.04, r (SSP, ME) = −.04; all p N .05).

We expected negative convergent validity (i.e., substantial negative
correlations) of DAM with PPI-R subscales carefree nonplanfulness (CN,
α              = .73), and rebellious nonconformity (RN, α = .89). 
Additionally, we
expected,  that  the  negative  correlations  of  these  scales  with  DAM
should be higher than the negative correlations with SSP. The data sup-
ported this expectation: r (DAM, CN) = −.58, r (DAM, RN) = −.12, all
p b .01); (r (SSP, CN) = −.25, p b .01, r (SSP, RN) = .02, ns); Δz (r (DAM,

CN) vs. r (SSP, CN) = 9.83, p b .01; Δz (r (DAM, RN) vs. r (SSP, RN) =

3.54, p b .01; for comparison of two correlation coefﬁcients from the
same sample, see Eid, Gollwitzer, and Schmitt (2011).

We expected positive convergent validity (i.e., substantial positive
correlations) of SSP with PPI-R subscales social inﬂuence (SOI, α = .85)
and   stress immunity (SI, α = .84). Additionally, we expected, that the
positive correlations of these scales with SSP should be higher than
the positive correlations with DAM. The data supported this expecta-
tion: (r  (SSP,  SOI)  = .45,  r  (SSP,  SI)  = .34,  all  p  b .01); (r  (DAM,

SOI) = .25, r (DAM, SI) = .22, all p b .01); Δz (r (SSP, SOI) vs. r (DAM,

SOI) = 5.67, p b .01; Δz (r (SSP, SI) vs. r (DAM, SI) = 3.16, all p b .01).

The DAM (α = .80) and the SSP (α = .75) scales correlated at r =

.47, p  b .01, which reﬂects that both  share the theme  of  ambition
(Hough, 1992). In sum, although DAM and SSP are correlated, the pat-
tern of discriminant and convergent validity coefﬁcients in this valida-
tion study demonstrate that both scales tap into different personality
domains.

3.2.4. Objective sales performance

To objectively assess sales revenue, we used the company's nine-
month-later sales performance data. In general, insurance products
with a single acquisition commission (e.g., life insurance) can be differ-
entiated from those with a recurring renewal commission (e.g., auto in-
surance). To make products (e.g. life & savings, health, property &
casualty) with different commission structures comparable between
product lines, the organization assigns points to each product sold and
aggregates them for an overall sales index/person, reﬂecting the com-
mission paid to the agent. The organization-developed point system
achieves comparability between both single acquisition and renewal
commission structures, allowing sales representatives to be compared
directly. The average sales revenue after nine months in our sample
was 118,444.88 points (SD = 86,915.45). Also, since we had a response
rate of 29%, we compared participants and non-participants regarding
their sales performance. Our results showed that there were no differ-
ences in performance between the two groups.

3.2.5. Control variables

Since research has shown that age (Vinchur et al., 1998), gender
(Bowen,  Swim,  &  Jacobs,  2000),  and  organizational  tenure  (Ng  &
Feldman, 2010) can be related to performance, we included these as
control variables. To control for its possible quadratic effects as found
by Grant (2013), we assessed positive affectivity (Watson et al., 1988),
as  it  is  closely  related  to  the  other  facets  of  extraversion,  such  
as
warmth, gregariousness, and positive emotions (Nemanick & Munz,
1997). Cronbach's Alpha for positive affectivity was α = .81.

3.3. Statistical analyses

3.3.1. Measurement models

To evaluate the independence and distinctiveness of our measures,
we  conducted  conﬁrmatory  factor  analyses.  Recent  research  has
shown that ﬁt-indices of structural equation models generally deterio-
rate  with  an  increasing  number  of  manifest  variables  (Moshagen,
2012). Consequently, we built two indicator variables for each construct
(i.e., DAM, SSP, and positive affectivity) to reduce the number of mani-
fest variables.

Mplus 7.0 (Muthén & Muthén, 1998-2012) was used to compare
two different models. In the ﬁrst model, the indicators loaded on their
respective  factors.  The  ﬁt  indices  of  this  model  were  satisfactory:



χ² = 9.95, df = 6, p = .12, RMSEA = .076, CFI = .988, and SRMR = .033.

In the second model, all indicators loaded together on one factor. The ﬁt
indices of this model were unsatisfactory: χ² = 105.99, df = 9, p b .000,
RMSEA = .307, CFI = .709, and SRMR = .099. Additionally, the ﬁrst
model demonstrated a signiﬁcantly better ﬁt than the second model:
ΔChi²= 96.04, Δdf = 3, p b .0001. These results support the distinctive-
ness of the measures used.

3.3.2. Hypothesis testing

To ensure that our dependent variable was normally distributed, we
investigated skewness (1.61) and kurtosis (2.84) and compared it to
common cut-off values (skewness: +/− 2; kurtosis: +/− 7, Curran,
West, & Finch, 1996), concluding that, although some distortion is pres-
ent, our measure is normally distributed. Based on Cohen, Cohen, West,
and Aiken (2003) and Jaccard and Turrisi (2003), hierarchical moderat-
ed regression analyses were conducted to examine DAM's prediction of
sales performance and the moderating role of SSP on the DAM – sales
performance relation. All predictors were standardized prior to both
building the interaction and quadratic terms and analysis. First, the lin-

third model, the linear and the quadratic interaction effects between
DAM and SSP were entered. In line with recent views that control vari-
ables may hamper analyses and bias results (Becker, 2005), we added
our control variables in the fourth model.

4. Results

Table 1 reports the means, standard deviations, correlations, and Co-
efﬁcient alpha (α) estimates of all variables. The correlation between
DAM and sales performance was signiﬁcant (r = .19, p b .05), and be-
tween SSP and performance it was non-signiﬁcant (r = .12, ns.), with
the estimates being in line with prior ﬁndings (r = .23 and .15, respec-
tively; Vinchur et al., 1998).

In line with the validation study, DAM and SSP correlated at r = .47
(p b .01). In hypothesis testing, we standardized both scales (Cohen et
al.,  2003)  and  controlled  for  the  quadratic  effects  of  both  scales
(Cortina, 1993). The results for our hypothesis are shown in Table 2.
The squared DAM x SSP interaction term was signiﬁcant in the fourth
model (β = .42, p b .05, ΔR² = 4%). This effect remained signiﬁcant
when the control variables were entered (Model 5: β = .40, p b .05).

The plot (following Dawson, 2014) of the quadratic interaction of
DAM is shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen, the slope of DAM for high SSP
exponentially increases when DAM is increasing and leads to better ob-
jective sales performance. The standardized inﬂection point (Le et al.,
2011) for this slope was −.69, indicating that the slope turns direction
at −.69 standard deviations from the mean.

For individuals low on SSP, the relation with objective sales perfor-
mance initially becomes stronger with increasing DAM, but, near the
mean, the slope starts to decrease, indicating that higher values of
DAM are related to worse sales performance. The standardized inﬂec-
tion point for the slope at low levels of SSP was .13.

5. Discussion

The results conﬁrm our hypotheses and extend literature on the per-
sonality–sales performance relation in a predictive study over 9 months.
The inverted U-shaped relation between disciplined achievement moti-
vation (DAM) and sales performance was moderated by stable social
potency (SSP), explaining an additional 4% of the variance beyond
main and moderating effects, and these effects remained when includ-
ing control variables. High conscientiousness can be expressed in be-
haviors  that  are  especially  detrimental  to  sales  performance  (see
Carter et al., 2016), but we demonstrated that when individuals are
high not only on DAM, but also SSP, their sales performance does not de-
teriorate, but increases, when compared to those lower on DAM. Given
the strong suggestion by the research community that practitioners hire
and promote individuals high on conscientiousness and the ubiquity of
sales positions in the modern economy, perhaps the primary contribu-
tion of our study is to show that the sales performance limitations of
the highly conscientious (i.e., high DAM) can be overcome when these
individuals also possess an above average degree of socially-related
traits.

Regarding other contributions, our ﬁndings support research indi-
cating the importance of narrow traits (Hogan & Holland, 2003; Robie
& Ryan, 1999), social skill (Hogan & Blickle, 2013), relevant context
(Tett & Burnett, 2003), and non-linearity (Penney et al., 2011) to the
personality-performance relation. Additionally, our study extends this

research by revealing the importance of emotional stability to these re-
lations in the sales context. Although prior research has shown that the
emotionally  unstable  are  more  stressed  during  social  interactions
(Kifﬁn-Petersen, Jordan, & Soutar, 2011), our research extends this liter-
ature to demonstrate the beneﬁts, within the sales context, of having
higher emotional stability, delivering greater speciﬁcity to our knowl-
edge of its function in social work environments.

Our study's strengths include the use of a predictive design over 9
months, objective sales data, narrowing our context to a speciﬁc sales
position within a particular organization, controlling for positive affec-
tivity to rule out the possible inﬂuence of positive emotions on these re-
lations, and a validation study to show the discriminant and convergent
validity of our predictors. Our research also has some limitations: Given
the unique nature of the intangible product (e.g., insurance) sales con-
text in our study, we cannot be certain how well our ﬁndings apply to
tangible sales (e.g., retail) or non-sales settings. However, it seems plau-
sible that socially-relevant traits would be beneﬁcial to the high consci-
entiousness in other enterprising occupations (Holland, 1997). Finally,
it is possible that the sales performance index created by the organiza-
tion to assess sales performance inequitably rewards certain products
over others. We believe this is quite unlikely, as the index was created
and is maintained with the purpose of equating different products.
But, future studies could replicate ours in a context including only prod-
ucts of one commission type. Future research also could test if these re-
lations hold in other sales or non-sales environments, examine other-
rated personality and social skill, and use other performance-related
(e.g., customer service, adaptive, and contextual) outcomes.
